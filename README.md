# RPAL Compiler

## Project Description

This project is a **compiler** for the **RPAL** (Recursive Procedural Algorithmic Language). The goal is to implement a **lexical analyzer** and a **parser** for RPAL programs, generating an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** as output. Further steps will involve converting the AST to a **Standardized Tree (ST)** and implementing a **CSE machine** to evaluate RPAL programs.

## Features

- **Lexical Analyzer**: Tokenizes the RPAL program.
- **Parser**: Generates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **AST to ST Conversion**: Converts the AST to a standardized tree.
- **CSE Machine**: Executes the RPAL program based on the ST.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rpal-compiler.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rpal-compiler
    ```

3. Run the RPAL compiler:
    ```bash
    python myrpal.py your_program.rpal
    ```

## Project Structure

- **`myrpal.py`**: The main entry point for running the RPAL compiler.
- **`lexer.py`**: Contains the lexical analysis code.
- **`parser.py`**: Contains the code to parse the tokens and generate the AST.
- **`ast.py`**: Contains the representation and methods related to the Abstract Syntax Tree.
- **`standardizer.py`**: Converts the AST to the Standardized Tree (ST).
- **`cse_machine.py`**: Implements the CSE machine to execute RPAL code.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains helper functions used throughout the project.
- **`tests/`**: Directory containing sample RPAL programs for testing.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and reports related to the project.
